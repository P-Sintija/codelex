<?php
//Foo Corporation needs a program to calculate how much to pay their hourly employees.
//The US Department of Labor requires that employees get paid time and a half for any hours over 40
// that they work in a single week. For example, if an employee works 45 hours,
// they get 5 hours of overtime, at 1.5 times their base pay.
// The State of Massachusetts requires that hourly employees be paid at least $8.00 an hour.
// Foo Corp requires that an employee not work more than 60 hours in a week.
//Summary
//An employee gets paid (hours worked) × (base pay), for each hour up to 40 hours.
//For every hour over 40, they get overtime = (base pay) × 1.5.
//The base pay must not be less than the minimum wage ($8.00 an hour). If it is, print an error.
//If the number of hours is greater than 60, print an error message.
//Write a method that takes the base pay and hours worked as parameters, and prints the total pay or an error.
// Write a main method that calls this method for each of these employees:

//Employee	Base Pay	Hours Worked
//Employee 1	$7.50	35
//Employee 2	$8.20	47
//Employee 3	$10.00	73
